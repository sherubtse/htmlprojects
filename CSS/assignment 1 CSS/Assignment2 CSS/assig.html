                    Sherubtse College is the first accredited college in Bhutan, founded in 1966 by a group of Jesuits under the leadership of William Mackey. It became a part of the newly created Royal University of Bhutan in 2003, a system that comprises all public post-secondary schools in Bhutan.

                    Nearly 300 students graduate every year from the college. It offers courses such as Economics, Computer Science, Dzongkha, English, Geography, and Science. Its most significant science department is the department of Botany and Environmental Science, which benefits from its location amidst the rich biodiversity of the Himalayan regions.
