   <h2  text-align="center" ><b><u>Dhugs Bank of Bhutan</u></b></h2>
	<p >Banking in Bhutan is an industry that has grown slowly as the country has pursued modernization. Since its establishment in 1982, the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan, headquartered in Thimphu, has served as the central bank of Bhutan. The authority is responsible for issuing currency, implementing monetary policy, coordinating financial institution activities, and holding the government's foreign exchange earnings. Among its initial duties was the administration of financial assistance for rural development, a duty later delegated to the Bhutan Development Finance Corporation which was founded in 1988.
    		<p>Jhe government of Bhutan established the Bhutan Development Finance Corporation (BDFCL) in 1988 with assistance from the Asian Development Bank to serve small and medium-sized enterprises,[2] and it took over the administration of rural financial assistance from the Royal Monetary Authority.[3] International multilateral organizations such as the Asian Development Bank subsidized BDFCL with grants and concessional loans.[2] Loans were granted[by whom?] for improving farmland, obtaining livestock, and meeting short-term seasonal requirements[clarification needed].[3] Some of the funding for the corporation, including an initial US$2.5 million loan in 1988 for the expansion of small- and medium-sized, private-sector industrial development, came from the Asian Development Bank.[3] The corporation had been privatized by 1991.[1][3]

In 2010, BDFCL began to function as an ordinary commercial bank, and was accordingly renamed Bhutan Development Bank (BDB).[2] As of 2014, BDB has more than 30 branches, 5 field offices, and 5 ATMs</p><a href="https://www.mathlearningcentre.com/bank/asia/bhutan" style="color: yellow;">...Read More!!</a>.
